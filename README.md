The demand for transparency in sustainable development from investors and customers has grown over the years.

Investors have placed an increased emphasis on sustainability of the business when assessing the value and resiliency of an organization.

Therefore, more and more organizations invest resources to build capabilities for sustainability reporting and determine the best strategies for a sustainable supply chain.

## **Article**
In this [Article](https://www.samirsaci.com/supply-chain-sustainability-reporting-with-python/), we will introduce a simple methodology to **report the CO2 emissions of your Distribution Network** using **Python and PowerBI**.

## **Definition**
Based on the GHG Protocol corporate standard (Link), greenhouse gas emissions are classified into three scopes:

- Scope 1: direct emissions emissions released to the atmosphere because of companyâ€™s activities (Companyâ€™s facilities like manufacturing plant/warehouses, companyâ€™s vehicles)
- Scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy
(purchased electricity, gas, ..)
- Scope 3: all indirect emissions (out of scope 2) occuring in the value chain of the company (Transportation, Waste of Operations, Business Travels, â€¦)

In this article we will focus our attention on the Scope 3 calculations related to downstream transportation.
What is the environmental impact of your distribution network?

## **Formula**
Following the protocol the French Environmental Agency Ademe (Link), the formula to estimate the CO2 emissions of transportation is:

## **Objective**

1. Based on this formula, we collect and process data to calculate the emissions.

2. We calculate the unit of measure conversions considering the shipped handling units.

3. We add distances by mode and compute the CO2 emissions by order
